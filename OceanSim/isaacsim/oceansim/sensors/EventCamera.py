        Args:
            prim_path (str): prim path of the Camera Prim to encapsulate or create.
            name (str, optional): shortname to be used as a key by Scene class.
                                    Note: needs to be unique if the object is added to the Scene.
                                    Defaults to "UW_Camera".
            frequency (Optional[int], optional): Frequency of the sensor (i.e: how often is the data frame updated).
                                                Defaults to None.
            dt (Optional[str], optional): dt of the sensor (i.e: period at which a the data frame updated). Defaults to None.
            resolution (Optional[Tuple[int, int]], optional): resolution of the camera (width, height). Defaults to None.
            position (Optional[Sequence[float]], optional): position in the world frame of the prim. shape is (3, ).
                                                        Defaults to None, which means left unchanged.
            translation (Optional[Sequence[float]], optional): translation in the local frame of the prim
                                                            (with respect to its parent prim). shape is (3, ).
                                                            Defaults to None, which means left unchanged.
            orientation (Optional[Sequence[float]], optional): quaternion orientation in the world/ local frame of the prim
                                                            (depends if translation or position is specified).
                                                            quaternion is scalar-first (w, x, y, z). shape is (4, ).
                                                            Defaults to None, which means left unchanged.
            render_product_path (str): path to an existing render product, will be used instead of creating a new render product
                                    the resolution and camera attached to this render product will be set based on the input arguments.
                                    Note: Using same render product path on two Camera objects with different camera prims, resolutions is not supported
